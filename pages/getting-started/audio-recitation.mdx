## Audio of a Verse

### Request format

Make a **GET** request to `/<reciterNo>/<surahNo>_<ayahNo>.mp3`

#### Example

Endpoint: [`/2/1_2.mp3`](https://quranaudio.pages.dev/2/1_2.mp3)<br />Raw Url: https://quranaudio.pages.dev/2/1_2.mp3

### Response

A `mp3` file will be returned.

<br />
<audio src="https://quranaudio.pages.dev/2/1_2.mp3" controls />

<br />
<br />

## Audio of a Chapter

As the audio recitation of a chapter is larger in size, I couldn't use _CloudFlare Pages_ for this. (As the maximum file size is **25MiB**)<br />Instead, the files are stored in **Github**. But there is also the original url from where the recitation was taken.

It's best to use the original URL if possible. However, if you can't access it, you can use the `url` property instead.

### Request format

Make a **GET** request to `/audio/<surahNo>.json`

#### Example

Endpoint: [`/audio/2.json`](/api/audio/2.json)<br />Raw Url: https://quranapi.pages.dev/api/audio/2.json

### Response

```json copy
