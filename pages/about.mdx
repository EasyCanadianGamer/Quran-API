# About

Quran API is a REST API that provides verses, chapters, and recitations of the Quran.
Unlike other APIs, it has no rate limit. The API will stay free forever.

The API was built and maintained by [Nusab Taha](https://nusab19.pages.dev).
Special thanks to [AH Nayef](https://github.com/ahnayef) for his contribution.

## Note

[Quran Bot](https://t.me/AlFurqanRobot) is a bot that provides the Quran through Telegram. The bot is more developed and has more features than the API.
