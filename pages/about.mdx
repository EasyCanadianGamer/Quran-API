# About

Quran API is a REST API that gives verses, chapters, translations, and more from the Quran. It is free to use and has no rate limits. The API is built and maintained by [Nusab Taha](https://nusab19.pages.dev).
It was first built just as a hobby project and to try out Nextra. Therefore, I did not maintain it for a long time. But after seeing the interest people have in the API, I decided to maintain it and add more features to it.

## Note

There is a Telegram bot that was built before this one. It is called [Quran Bot](https://t.me/AlFurqanRobot). The bot is more developed and has more features than the API. 

If you need the `.json` files of the Quran and the translations, you can find them [here](https://github.com/The-Quran-Project/The-Quran-Bot/tree/main/bot/Data)
